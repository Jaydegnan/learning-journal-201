Today I learned about events. Events are how your browser interacts and responds to your input.
This occurs when users click on a link, hover over an element, type on the keyboard, resize the window or when the page has loaded.
Different code can be triggered when users interact with different parts of the page.
These events can trigger javascript changes that will alter the DOM model.

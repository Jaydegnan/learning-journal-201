Today in class we were paired into groups and did a lab together on merge conflicts.
Essentially we made mistakes on purpose by using the wrong commands in wrong orders with github and gitbash, and then found a way to resole these issues.
It is important to make sure everyone in the group is on the same page, and no 2 people are working on the same lines of code.
These can cause serious problems if everyone is not in sync.
We reviewed what to expect from course 301, and went over the upcoming test.

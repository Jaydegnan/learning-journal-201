Today we learned about the DOM. The DOM is essentially an outline that turns an html page into what we can see in the browser. It has 4 types of nodes - root, element, attribute, text.
We also learned about objects. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
Furthermore, we learned how to find things in html using a javascript document, much like how you can use scripts in html to access javascript.
